# 🚚 ShipCal - Amazon Self-Ship Report

A React-based web application that helps Amazon sellers calculate shipping charges for self-ship orders. The app processes CSV files, aggregates orders, and computes shipping costs by state using configurable shipping rates.

## ✨ Features

- **📁 Smart File Upload**: Upload Amazon Order Report in TXT or CSV format (shipping rates are built-in)
- **🔄 Automatic TXT to CSV Conversion**: Seamlessly converts tab-delimited TXT files to CSV format
- **🚚 Smart Order Filtering**: Only processes orders with "Shipped" status
- **🔄 Order Aggregation**: Groups multiple order lines by Order ID
- **⚖️ Weight Calculation**: Automatically calculates weights based on product pack types
  - Pack of One: 500g (0.5kg)
  - Pack of Two: 1kg (1.0kg)
- **📊 Shipping Cost Calculation**: Applies state-specific rates with automatic weight rounding
- **📋 Results Display**: Clean table showing all order details and calculations
- **📥 CSV Export**: Export results for further analysis
- **🎯 Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing states and malformed data
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV Files

#### Amazon Order Report (TXT or CSV)
Your order report should contain these columns:
- `amazon-order-id`: Unique order identifier
- `product-name`: Product description (should contain "Pack of 1" or "Pack of 2")
- `quantity`: Number of items ordered
- `ship-state`: Destination state for shipping
- `order-status`: Order status (only "Shipped" orders will be processed)

#### Built-in State-wise Shipping Rates
The app includes predefined shipping rates for all Indian states:
- Rates range from ₹45/kg (Goa, Kerala) to ₹65/kg (Arunachal Pradesh)
- Default rate of ₹60/kg for any state not found in the predefined list
- No separate file upload required

### Step 2: Upload Order File

1. Click "Choose File" under "Amazon Order Report" and select your order file (TXT or CSV)
2. If uploading a TXT file, the app will automatically convert it to CSV format
3. Wait for the green "✅ Uploaded" confirmation
4. Note: Shipping rates are built-in and don't need to be uploaded

### Step 3: Calculate Shipping

1. Click the "🧮 Calculate Self-Ship Costs" button
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Review the results table

### Step 4: Export Results

1. Click "📥 Export CSV" to download the calculated results
2. The exported file will contain all calculations and can be used for further analysis

## 🧮 Calculation Logic

### Weight Calculation
- **Pack of One**: 0.5kg per unit
- **Pack of Two**: 1.0kg per unit
- **Total Weight**: (Pack of One qty × 0.5) + (Pack of Two qty × 1.0)
- **Rounded Weight**: Math.ceil(Total Weight) - always rounds up to next whole kg

### Shipping Cost Calculation
- **Rate Lookup**: Finds rate for destination state from rates CSV
- **Default Rate**: ₹60/kg used if state not found in rates file
- **Final Cost**: Rounded Weight × Rate per kg

### Order Filtering and Aggregation
- **Filters for Shipped Orders Only**: Only processes orders with `order-status = "Shipped"`
- **Groups all items** with the same Order ID
- **Sums quantities** for each pack type
- **Uses the shipping state** from any line item in the order
- **Shows filtering statistics** in the results summary

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing Default Shipping Rate
Edit the `DEFAULT_RATE` constant in `src/App.js`:
```javascript
const DEFAULT_RATE = 60; // Change this value
```

### Modifying Weight Calculations
Adjust the weight calculation logic in the `processOrders` function:
```javascript
const totalWeight = (order.packOfOne * 0.5) + (order.packOfTwo * 1.0);
```

### Adding New Pack Types
Extend the `extractPackInfo` function to recognize additional pack types:
```javascript
const extractPackInfo = (productName) => {
  const packOfOne = /Pack of 1/i.test(productName) ? 1 : 0;
  const packOfTwo = /Pack of 2/i.test(productName) ? 1 : 0;
  // Add more pack types here
  return { packOfOne, packOfTwo };
};
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
